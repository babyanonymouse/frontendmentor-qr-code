## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- TailwindCSS

### What I learned

I learnt how to use **flexbox** using _tailwindcss_.

```html
<div class="flex-col min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center"></div>
```

linking html with tailwind using the config file and css

```js
  content: ["./*.html"],
```

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

### Continued development

flexbox is easy but complex in some way. This needs more work

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Docs](https://tailwindcss.com) - This helped me for know some tailwind class utils.
